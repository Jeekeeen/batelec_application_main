### Overview of The Project ###
Batelec GO! is an innovative application designed to streamline the payment process and outage tracking within the designated grid area onto handheld or mobile devices. End-users who are subscribed to the electricity provider will be able to view and act upon critical information such as their recurring billing for the current month, choose different payment options, and view previous payment history.

## ***Introduction*** ##
Batelec, one of the primary Electric Cooperatives in Batangas province, is dedicated to providing reliable electricity distribution to its residents. However, inefficient payment methods such as walk-in payment systems and a lack of communication regarding interruption schedules to end-users hurt the provider’s customer relationship and payment process.

## ***Challenges*** ##
Inefficient Payment Methods: The traditional walk-in payment system is cumbersome for customers, requiring them to take time out of their busy schedules to visit payment centers physically. This method is not only inconvenient but also time-consuming, leading to delayed payments and potential service interruptions.

Lack of Communication: Batelec’s current communication channels are insufficient for effectively informing customers about scheduled interruptions and brownouts. This lack of timely updates can cause significant disruptions for residents and businesses, impacting their daily activities and productivity.

## ***Solution: Batelec Application*** ###
To address these challenges and enhance the user experience, we present the Batelec Application. This mobile application is designed to streamline various services and provide users with a convenient way to manage their electricity services.

### ***Key Features*** ###
Easy Bill Viewing: Users can easily view their electricity bills on the app, eliminating the need for physical bill statements. This feature allows users to keep track of their payment history and outstanding amounts in a centralized, accessible location.

Secure Online Payments: The app provides a secure platform for users to pay their electricity bills online. This feature simplifies the payment process, making it quick and hassle-free. Users can pay their bills from anywhere, at any time, reducing the risk of late payments and service disconnections.

Electricity Consumption Tracking: Users can monitor their daily electricity consumption through the app. This feature helps users understand their usage patterns, identify opportunities for energy savings, and manage their electricity consumption more effectively.

Scheduled Interruption Notifications: The app keeps users informed about scheduled brownouts and interruptions. Timely notifications allow users to plan their activities around these interruptions, minimizing inconvenience and ensuring better preparedness.

News and Updates: The Batelec Application also provides users with the latest news and updates related to electricity services in the province. This feature ensures that users are well-informed about any changes or developments that may affect their electricity supply.

### ***Objectives*** ###
1. To provide Batelec customers with a user-friendly mobile application for managing their electricity services.
2. To streamline the bill payment process by offering secure and convenient payment options.
3. To enhance communication between Batelec and its customers regarding scheduled outages and service requests.

### ***Project Description*** ###
### Scope and Limitations ###
Scope:

The Batelec Application project aims to design and develop a user-friendly mobile application that will enhance the overall experience for Batelec customers by providing convenient access to essential electricity services. The application will focus on front-end development using Dart and Flutter, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user interface. The primary scope of this project includes:

Feature Development: Implementation of core features such as viewing energy usage and billing history, secure bill payment, tracking daily electricity consumption, and receiving notifications about scheduled brownouts.
User Interface Design: Creating a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface that allows users to effortlessly access and utilize the app's features.
Prototype Development: Developing a functional prototype that can serve as a foundation for future enhancements and potential deployment.
Limitations:

The development of the Batelec Application is subject to several limitations, which may impact the scope and overall effectiveness of the project. These limitations include:

No Backend Integration: The project does not encompass backend development; therefore, real-time data integration, server-side functionalities, and actual user data handling will not be implemented. The app will rely solely on mock data, which may not fully represent real-world usage.
Prototype Nature: As a prototype, the application may not include all potential features required for a fully functional product. Additional development and testing will be necessary to transition from a prototype to a deployable solution.
